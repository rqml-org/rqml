Add the rest of the interactive-RQML capabilities (2–5).

- **Spec overview (cap 5):** `@rqml/core` `projectOutline` scopes the document outline by section or id; `rqml overview` (CLI) and `rqml_overview` (MCP) render the whole spec or a subset as markdown + JSON.
- **Status transition / approve (cap 4):** `@rqml/core` `setStatus` performs a textual, comment-preserving status edit; `rqml approve` (CLI) and `rqml_approve` (MCP) transition a requirement's lifecycle status as an explicit-intent write.
- **Approval gate (cap 3):** `@rqml/core` `approvalGate` flags implementation linked to non-approved requirements; `rqml gate` (CLI, exit 2 when blocked) and `rqml_gate` (MCP) expose it so editor/agent/CI hooks can block — no language model in the verdict path.
- **MCP data-plane boundary (cap 2):** the server advertises only the `tools` capability and depends on no optional MCP client feature, keeping every capability reachable on tools-only hosts at CLI parity.
- The bundled `AGENTS.md` template and the website tooling docs document the new commands and tools.
